  Basic Tests
===============

These are basic tests for scabbard they are more useful as debugging tools than as meaningful tests.


The test scripts (`.sh`) are written specific for my environment on LLNL's Tioga compute cluster, 
  and will need to be modified to be used in other environments
Feel free to use them as guides on how to run and use scabbard in a more direct way.

Files that have a `.man` as part of their file are meant to be used without the instrumentation portion of scabbard.
